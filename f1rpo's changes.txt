This is a fork of K-Mod 1.46 with a few dozen bugfixes and other hopefully
unobjectionable changes from AdvCiv. It can be played as an "unofficial"
K-Mod version, however, the main point is the Git commit history, from which
other mods can cherry-pick -- especially mods based on K-Mod, but I've also
fixed some BBAI and BtS bugs.
